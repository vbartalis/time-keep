# The app

A SvelteKit 3.1 server (adapter-node 6) over SQLite through Drizzle, TypeScript
throughout (decision 1). The UI is Tailwind and shadcn-svelte (decision 2). The app
owns every write to the database.

Imports use `#lib` (the `imports` map in `package.json`, `src/lib/*`), not `$lib`.
Hook types come from `@sveltejs/kit/hooks`.

## Layout

| Path | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `src/hooks.server.ts` | `init`: run migrations, ensure the first admin. `handle`: resolve the session cookie into `locals.user` and `locals.session`, renew or clear the cookie. |
| `src/lib/server/db/` | `index.ts` opens SQLite (WAL, foreign keys on) and holds the single `getDb()` instance; `schema.ts` is the Drizzle schema; `migrate.ts` applies `drizzle/` at startup. |
| `src/lib/server/auth/credentials.ts` | Username and password rules, argon2id hashing and verification. |
| `src/lib/server/auth/sessions.ts` | Create, validate, renew and invalidate sessions; the session cookie. |
| `src/lib/server/auth/throttle.ts` | In-memory sign-in throttle. |
| `src/lib/server/auth/bootstrap.ts` | Creates the first admin from the environment. |
| `src/lib/server/users.ts` | User operations: create, list, authenticate, set password, change own password, disable and enable. Returns `Result` values instead of throwing for expected failures. |
| `src/lib/server/guards.ts` | `requireUser` (redirect to `/login`) and `requireAdmin` (403). |
| `src/lib/server/id.ts` | Random base32 ids. |
| `src/routes/login`, `logout` | Sign in and out. |
| `src/routes/(app)/` | Signed-in screens: home, `account`, `admin/users`. The layout requires a user. |
| `src/routes/healthz` | Health check: `{"status":"ok"}`, or 503 when the database fails a query. |
| `drizzle/` | Generated SQL migrations. |
| `e2e/` | Playwright tests. |

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `DATABASE_PATH` | `./data/time-keep.db` | SQLite file. The directory is created. The image sets `/data/time-keep.db`. |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | none | The first admin. Read only while no admin exists; startup fails if there is none and these are unset. |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Listen port. |
| `PROTOCOL_HEADER`, `HOST_HEADER` | unset locally | Where adapter-node builds the request origin. |
| `ADDRESS_HEADER`, `XFF_DEPTH` | unset locally | Where the client address comes from (sign-in throttle). |

There is no `ORIGIN`. adapter-node 6 builds the origin from `PROTOCOL_HEADER` and
`HOST_HEADER`, and takes the scheme as https when no protocol header is set, so form
posts over plain http are refused. Behind a proxy set the headers (the image does).
A local `node build` over plain http needs `PROTOCOL_HEADER=x-forwarded-proto` and a
client that sends `x-forwarded-proto: http`; the e2e does this.

`DATABASE_PATH`, `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` are declared in `src/env.ts` and
read through SvelteKit's `$app/env/private`, so the dev server picks them up from `.env`
as well as from real environment variables in production. `drizzle.config.ts` reads
`process.env.DATABASE_PATH` directly (drizzle-kit runs outside SvelteKit).

`.env.example` lists the variables.

## Running

```
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Migrations run and the admin is created from `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` at
server start in production; the dev server does this lazily on the first request. Other scripts: `npm run build`, `check`, `lint`, `format`.

## Migrations

Change `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts`, then `npm run db:generate` (drizzle-kit
generate) and commit the SQL in `drizzle/`. The app applies pending migrations at
startup. Never use `db:push`; the schema is changed only through reviewed migration
files.

## Tests

- `npm run test:unit` runs Vitest over `src/**/*.test.ts` against in-memory SQLite.
- `npm run test:e2e` runs Playwright (`e2e/`) against a production build served on
  port 4173 with a throwaway database in `test-results/e2e`, in a phone project and a
  PC project.
- `npm test` runs both.

Chromium needs system libraries and fonts. The devcontainer image installs them, so
after rebuilding the devcontainer `npm run test:e2e` runs as is. Until the rebuild,
unpack the libraries into a user cache and run with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and
`FONTCONFIG_FILE` pointing at it.

## Accounts and sessions

Decision 3 is the rule; these are the details.

- Usernames are trimmed and lowercased, 3 to 32 characters of `a-z`, `0-9`, `.`, `_`,
  `-`. Passwords are 10 to 256 characters.
- Passwords are hashed with argon2id. A sign-in for an unknown username still verifies
  against a dummy hash, so timing does not reveal which usernames exist. Failures
  always read "Wrong username or password.", including for disabled accounts.
- The session token is 20 random bytes as base32, sent in an `httpOnly`,
  `sameSite=lax` cookie named `session` (`secure` over https). Only its SHA-256 is
  stored. Sessions last 30 days and are renewed to 30 days on use once under 15 days
  remain.
- Sign-out deletes the session. Changing a password invalidates the user's other
  sessions and keeps the current one; an admin setting a password invalidates all of
  that user's sessions. Disabling a user deletes their sessions, and a disabled user's
  session never validates.
- The sign-in throttle keys on username and client address: 5 failures within 15
  minutes lock the pair for 15 minutes. It is in memory and resets on restart.
- The first admin comes from the environment, only while no admin exists. The admin
  flag is set at creation and has no edit path. Admins create users, set passwords and
  disable or enable anyone except themselves. Users are never deleted. Setting a
  password or disabling an unknown id returns "User not found."

## Image

The `Dockerfile` builds with adapter-node and runs `node build` as the `node` user.
It sets `DATABASE_PATH=/data/time-keep.db`, `PORT=3000`, `PROTOCOL_HEADER=x-forwarded-proto`,
`HOST_HEADER=x-forwarded-host`, `ADDRESS_HEADER=X-Forwarded-For` and `XFF_DEPTH=1`,
which suits one reverse proxy (Coolify's). `/data` is a volume and must be persistent.
The image contains `drizzle/` for startup migrations. The healthcheck calls
`/healthz`. Set `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the deployment environment
for the first start.
